that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence  which set in right from the word go  trust me  this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid  this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs  sex or violence  its is hardcore  in the classic use of the word  br    br   it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary  it focuses mainly on emerald city  an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards  so privacy is not high on the agenda  em city is home to many  aryans  muslims  gangstas  latinos  christians  italians  irish and more    so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away  br    br   i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn t dare  forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance   oz doesn t mess around  the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  i couldn t say i was ready for it  but as i watched more  i developed a taste for oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence  not just violence  but injustice  crooked guards who ll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who ll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience  watching oz  you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing    thats if you can get in touch with your darker side ', 'a wonderful little production   br    br   the filming technique is very unassuming  very old time bbc fashion and gives a comforting  and sometimes discomforting  sense of realism to the entire piece   br    br   the actors are extremely well chosen  michael sheen not only  has got all the polari  but he has all the voices down pat too  you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams  diary entries  not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece  a masterful production about one of the great master s of comedy and his life   br    br   the realism really comes home with the little things  the fantasy of the guard which  rather than use the traditional  dream  techniques remains solid then disappears  it plays on our knowledge and our senses  particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets  particularly of their flat with halliwell s murals decorating every surface  are terribly well done ', 'i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend  sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy  the plot is simplistic  but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable  even the well bread suspected serial killer   while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2  risk addiction  i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love  br    br   this was the most i d laughed at one of woody s comedies in years  dare i say a decade?   while i ve never been impressed with scarlet johanson  in this she managed to tone down her  sexy  image and jumped right into a average  but spirited young woman  br    br   this may not be the crown jewel of his career  but it was wittier than  devil wears prada  and more interesting than  superman  a great comedy to go see with friends ', 'basically there s a family where a little boy  jake  thinks there s a zombie in his closet   his parents are fighting all the time  br    br   this movie is slower than a soap opera    and suddenly  jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie  br    br   ok  first of all when you re going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama  as a drama the movie is watchable  parents are divorcing   arguing like in real life  and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film  i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie  and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots  br    br   3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents   descent dialogs  as for the shots with jake  just ignore them ', 'petter mattei s  love in the time of money  is a visually stunning film to watch  mr  mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations  this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money  power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter   br    br   this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler s play about the same theme  the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect  each one is connected in one way  or another to the next person  but no one seems to know the previous point of contact  stylishly  the film has a sophisticated luxurious look  we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat  br    br   the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits  a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment  as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter  br    br   the acting is good under mr  mattei s direction  steve buscemi  rosario dawson  carol kane  michael imperioli  adrian grenier  and the rest of the talented cast  make these characters come alive  br    br   we wish mr  mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work ', 'probably my all time favorite movie  a story of selflessness  sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause  but it s not preachy or boring  it just never gets old  despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years  paul lukas  performance brings tears to my eyes  and bette davis  in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles  is a delight  the kids are  as grandma says  more like  dressed up midgets  than children  but that only makes them more fun to watch  and the mother s slow awakening to what s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling  if i had a dozen thumbs  they d all be  up  for this movie ', 'i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero s every week you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies so any ole way i believe i ve got what i wanna say would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit if this is so then i must go so lets do it ', 'this show was an amazing  fresh   innovative idea in the 70 s when it first aired  the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant  but things dropped off after that  by 1990  the show was not really funny anymore  and it s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today  br    br   it s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen  the writing is painfully bad  the performances are almost as bad   if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts  this show probably wouldn t still be on the air  i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed  how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success  as it is now  the show is just awful  i can t believe it s still on the air ', 'encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film  bad mistake  i ve seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them   it s awful in almost every way  editing  pacing  storyline   acting   soundtrack  the film s only song   a lame country tune   is played no less than four times   the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme  rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film   br    br   the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1 score is harvey keitel   while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort  one for keitel obsessives only ', 'if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie  if you are young or old then you will love this movie  hell even my mom liked it  br    br   great camp   ', 'phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines  br    br   at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn t find the jokes or oddness funny anymore  br    br   its a low budget film  thats never a problem in itself   there were some pretty interesting characters  but eventually i just lost interest  br    br   i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking  br    br   for something similar but better try  brother from another planet ', 'i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out  i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air  the horror  the horror  br    br   as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons  i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero  a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end  i didn t care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots  i love them now for the unintentional humor  br    br   but  about a year or so later  i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star  janet leigh  was bumped off early in the film  i sat up and took notice at that point  since screenwriters are making up the story  make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well worn formula  there are no rules ', 'so im not a big fan of boll s work but then again not many are  i enjoyed his movie postal  maybe im the only one   boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished   br    br   people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned  that this is not far cry    this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks   feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with  these players go by the names of til schweiger  udo kier and ralf moeller  br    br   three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz  so the tale goes like this  jack carver played by til schweiger  yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes    however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass   people have complained about how he s not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a      br    br   however  the storyline in this film is beyond demented  we see the evil mad scientist dr  krieger played by udo kier  making genetically mutated soldiers or gms as they are called  performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of  spoiler  vancouver for some reason  thats right no palm trees here  instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods  we haven t even gone far before i started to cry  mehehe  i cannot go on any more   if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience  meaning most of it will suck  br    br   there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes  until the whole cromed albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh   the movie far cry reeks of scheisse  that s poop for you simpletons  from a fa r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead   btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he s on screen ', 'the cast played shakespeare  br    br   shakespeare lost  br    br   i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses  but why ruin something so good  br    br   is it because  the scottish play  is my favorite shakespeare? i do not know  what i do know is that a certain rev bowdler  hence bowdlerization  tried to do something similar in the victorian era  br    br   in other words  you cannot improve perfection  br    br   i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text  and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie  as the saying goes  just does not cut it ', 'this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous  one of the actors is george clooney and i m not a fan but this roll is not bad  another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack  the man of constant sorrow   i recommand this movie to everybody  greetings bart', 'kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes  only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i ve ever seen  sort of like a high school film project  what was rosanna arquette thinking?? and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town? pretty hard to get involved with this one  no lessons to be learned from it  no brilliant insights  just stilted and quite ridiculous  but lots of skin  if that intrigues you  videotaped nonsense    what was with the bisexual relationship  out of nowhere  after all the heterosexual encounters  and what was with that absurd dance  with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? give this one a pass  it s like a million other miles of bad  wasted film  money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa     ', 'some films just simply should not be remade  this is one of them  in and of itself it is not a bad film  but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title  liam neeson was excellent as he always is  and most of the cast holds up  with the exception of owen wilson  who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke  but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects  again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film  but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more ', 'this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies  horrible   br    br   there wasn t a continuous minute where there wasn t a fight with one monster or another  there was no chance for any character development  they were too busy running from one sword fight to another  i had no emotional attachment  except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them   br    br   scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies  lotr  star wars and matrix   br    br   examples br    br    the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda  obee one and vader   br    br    the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings   elijah wood is the victim in both films  and wait      it hypnotizes  stings  its victim and wraps them up     uh hello???? br    br    and the whole machine vs  humans theme was the matrix  or terminator      br    br   there are more examples but why waste the time? and will someone tell me what was with the nazi s? ?  nazi s????  br    br   there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion  the movie could not decide if it was a children s movie or an adult movie and wasn t much of either   br    br   just awful  a real disappointment to say the least  save your money ', 'i remember this film it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74 75 my dad took me my brother   sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england  i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies  if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away  would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it ', 'an awful film  it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe  they ve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition  my complaint is not that they ve taken liberties with the facts  if the story were good  that would perfectly fine  but it s simply bizarre    by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film  so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script? i suppose there weren t enough naked people in the factual version  it s hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist s life    we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they d favored the rest of the film with same brevity ', 'after the success of die hard and it s sequels it s no surprise really that in the 1990s  a

box band of baddies  and best of all  the permanently harassed and hapless  turncoat  agent  rex linn as travers  br    br   he may of been henry in  portrait of a serial killer  but michael rooker is

movie first comes on  it seems like it s going to be your usual b movie  down to the crappy fx  but all a sudden  boom  the anime comes on  this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill  br    br   the animation is very bad   cheap  even worse than what i remember from speed racer  for crissakes  in fact  it s so cheap  one of the few scenes from the movie i  vividly  remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school      it s the same kids over   over again  the fx are terrible  too  the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla  in addition  the transition to live action to animation is unorganized  the dialogue   voices especially the english dub that i viewed  was horrid   i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd  vhs player  the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes   comments like the robots   joel mike on mst3k  you pick the season   honestly  this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie   survive it at the same time  br    br   heck  i m planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a b movie night  because it s stupid  pretty painful to watch   unintentionally hilarious at the same time  i m giving this movie a 3 10  an improvement from the 0 5 10 i was originally going to give it  br    br    according to my grading scale  3 10 means pretty much both boring   bad  as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it  then it will become as fun as counting to 15  ', 'this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards  i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film  it s great to see j beals but she s only in the movie for a few minutes  m parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for  the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable  the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch  there is no real emotional depth to the story  a movie revolving about an actor who can t get work doesn t feel very original to me  nor does the development of the cop  it feels like one of many straight to video movies i saw back in the 90s     and not even a good one in those standards  br    br   ', 'the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter s complex life  though it

an exotic masterpiece  a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer  but also into one of a very talented director  this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations  this is boldness at work  pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent  this is the best movie of the year to date  br    br   i ve read numerous complaints about this film  anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting  to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point  this movie may be a landmark  a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow   the cell  has just opened the door to another world of imagination  so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we don t want any more? personally  i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem  and would love to see someone try to challenge him  br    br   we ve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer  and yes  i do agree that the  genre  is a bit overworked  the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick  some of them worked  but most failed  but  the cell  does not blaze down the same trail  we are given a new twist  we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied  br    br   i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another  instead  she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity   the cell  wants to let you  see  what it s all about and not  how  it s all about  and i guess that s what some people don t like  true  i do like explanations with my movies  but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in  br    br   i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality  maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of

fantastic i thought  the cell  was  if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye popping feast then you are assured a good time  i guess this film was just a little too much for some people  writing it off as  weird  or  crazy   i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind  so it was right down my alley  leaving the

to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique  rather than simply the poor writing  direction  and production of this particular film  br    br   there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war  but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening  reminds me a bit of three kings  which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern ',

talk  that little girl who was always hanging on someone? i just hated her and had to mention it  now  the final scene transcends  i must say  it s so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a

top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large scale combat  once in a while  however  a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen  the civil war era  cold mountain   starring jude law  nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such a film  br    br   then again  calling cold mountain  a war movie is not entirely accurate  true enough  the film opens with a  quite literally  quick and dirty battle sequence that puts  glory  director edward zwick shame  however   cold mountain  is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times  the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman  played by jude law  who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain  north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind  ada monroe  played by nicole kidman  at first glance  this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier s tribulations on the battlefield  indeed  the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived  br    br    cold mountain  soon takes a drastic turn  though  as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter  incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates  and begins a long odyssey homeward  meanwhile  back at the farm  ada s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields  soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast  coming to ada s rescue is the course  tough as nails ruby thewes  played by renée zellweger  who helps ada put the farm back together and  perhaps more importantly  cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada  br    br   within these two settings  a vivid  compelling and  at times  very disturbing portrait of the war torn south unfolds  the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex  enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby s deadbeat father  ray winstone as an unrepentant southern  lawman   and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother  all have been greatly affected and changed by  the war of northern aggression   mostly for the worse  the dark  pervading anti war message  accented by an effective  haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina  is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought  though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century  it s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant  br    br   director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film  but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters  the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film  though the inherently distant  abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot  br    br   make no mistake   cold mountain  has neither the traits of a feel good romance nor an inspiring war drama  it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether ', 'taut and organically gripping  edward dmytryk s crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller

politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing  but it s pretty much confined to young s reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier

prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer   br    br   but while the change from homophobia to anti semitism works in general  the specifics don t fit so smoothly  the victim s chatting up a

inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip off to the original engine generating ryan s murderous rage ', ' ardh satya  is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema  directed by the great

exposure to the templarios   not a good one  i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video  which has brought us other cult classics such as  spider baby   the print

originally from salerno in southern italy  when we re introduced to him at the start of the film  he s been living a non life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years  conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to  while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo s cash tell him that 10 000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes  at the news  he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account  meanwhile he tells us  the spectators  that when you bluff  you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous  he says  you can t bluff for a while and then halfway through  tell the truth  having eventually done this   bluffed only halfway through and told the truth  and having accepted the

man on the verge of 50  a man who won t even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye  becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about  at one point in his non life  titta decides to feel concern about appearing  ridiculous   the first half of the film may be described as  slow  by some  it does indeed reveal di girolamo s days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined  deliberate pace  revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details  however  scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes  the existence of titta di girolamo   the man with no imagination  identity or life  the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving

out    br    br   never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell amore or l imbalsamatore  another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist s insomnia  not unlike the machinist  and in a far more explicit way  the al pacino film insomnia   le conseguenze dell amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that s been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious  it s almost impossible to pin point its cause  if indeed there is one    br    br   the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia  played by olivia magnani  grand daughter of the legendary anna  and the memory of titta s best friend  a man whom he hasn t seen in 20

to a man like titta  accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences  a film without a single scene of sex or violence  a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator s expectations  le conseguenze dell amore is a fine representative of that small  quiet  discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of

is a nice touch  the drummer is very like a drummer  i e damned annoying and  well thats about it actually  the problem is that its just so boring  in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension  a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious  i had my thumb on the fast forward button  ready to press for most of the movie  but gave it a go  and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking  coz they don t half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot  i thought he looked a bit like a meercat  all this and i haven t even mentioned the killer

actually quite funny  it wasn t because of their acting talent  i ve certainly seen a lot worse  but i ve also seen a lot better  best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry ', 'i bought this film at blockbuster for  3 00  because it sounded interesting  a bit ranma esque  with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton   because there was a cute girl in a mini skirt on the back  and

acting  and i thought   well  maybe it will get better   unfortunately  it never did  the picture starts out by introducing two elders    mormon missionaries    and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them  instead  the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries  something that undeniably exists  but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays  and it becomes almost laughable  br    br   dutcher s only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience  by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries  dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience  the film in no way reflects reality

corruption  war time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity  the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker  during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in nyc  who co authored the script were a perfect match for hitchcock s sensibilities  br    br   this often neglected film

lives his life vicariously through sir  without sir to need him  he is nothing  or thinks he is  anyway  br    br   this is a character driven film  the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters  and as such  it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life  finney  only 47 years old  is completely believable as a very old  very sick  petulant  bullying  but brilliant stage actor  he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they re taking their bows  and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser  who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer  employer is really the wrong term to use  though  for although  technically their relationship is that of employer and employee  most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple  br    br   yes  there are others in the cast of this movie  but there is no question that the true stars are finney  courtenay  and the marvelous script by

about old desires  old regrets  and what might have been  br    br   although it doesn t get talked about these days  it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards

or anyone looking to check out some of fulci s non splatter films   but don t despair  don t torture still has more than it s fair share of violence and sleaze  some may be put off by the subject of

means  on may 26 about 10 30 pm the movie started with a scene in the late 1800 s  old movies i like but not golf however  within the first scene a young boy  harry vardon  is awaken by the voices of men  he goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something    so   then i turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on  the movie is excellent  we then see this young boy now a man  professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood  then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf  you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period  then there is little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in francis winning  don t want to give away too much   i was up until 2 a m  this is super please see the movie ', 'upon viewing tobe hooper s gem  crocodile  in

keeps saying  hi  kids  into the camera like a buffoon   but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal  bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator  turns out it s way too sleazy for its own good  or bad  or whatever  there s a problem  and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust  similar to this in many respects  in not having balance to the sex and violence  too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno  and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies  and with the killing scenes  there has to be at least a little tack  and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity  in creating the creature killer whatever  entrails of a virgin has neither  it s safe to say it s a pretty soulless movie  even if isn t one of the very worst ever made  it s there just for horn dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their  other  heads  br    br   in this case  we re given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls  nothing too salacious  and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by  a murderer  as he s credited  first off  the director kazuo  gaira  komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on  we get spliced in  or phoned in  take your pick  clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere  it looks like it s from another movie  then once settled into the house  there s a  wrestling  scene that s poorly choreographed and shot  yeah  we really need to see him  all  there   and then on to the rape and killings  first the rape  by the photographers  who promise the girls some jobs for their time  then the murderer  who like d amato s creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial  and who for an unknown reason kills the men and or rapes the women one by one  br    br   now  the latter of those  taken by themselves  should be considered the highlights of the movie  this is like saying  however  that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad  an eye gouging scene  a spike thrown like an olympic event  that scene  actually  is kind of cool   and finally the entrailing of the overly sex crazed girl  whose inconsequential name i can t remember  even  this  becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title  on top of this  the sex scenes  which become tedious through  gaira  and his indulgence in long takes without cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway  are dubbed over by the actors  you d think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough  hence the need to let them  speak  for themselves   but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one  where it s just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror  watch as the last girl left alive  the virgin of the picture  tries to stop the murderer from getting to her  which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him   you just want it to be done with  for the  i hate women  mantra to ease up or be rid altogether ', 'the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes  when sharif or  please god  palance try their hand at fiery oratory  they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug  the displays of strategic brilliance

figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end  br    br   the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution  the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential  the screenplay was probably the worst part about it  it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie  it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea  he just didn t know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time  the second half of the film was running low on ideas  the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful  br    br   joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he s still capable of making a stinker  he has the movie drenched in style but he just can t get a good focus  he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace  he switches from reality to what s actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying  the actual book in the film that s titled  the number 23  is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears  when carrey is finally done with book  we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery  at this point  the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension  we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it s horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished  br    br   the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable  jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn t even seem to be trying  he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden  his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character  virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts  logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston  overall  the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills

is in a nutshell  br    br   i wanted mindless entertainment  and i got it with this  in regard to the genre of romantic films  this one fails to be memorable   a secret affair  with janine turner is

a disaster  after watching this film  you would swear george w  bush had his hands all over the making of this film    yes its that idiotic  br    br   stay away  unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time  its probably how lion s gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe ', 'i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember  i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid  this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new  super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise  there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it  while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario  the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space  br    br   the story begins much like any other mario game  mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom  upon arriving at peach s castle mario finds bowser and his son  bowser jr   attacking the castle with their airships  bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space  in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet  mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma s home  a floating space station  here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader  a woman named rosalina  rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station s power stars and scattered them across the universe  it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach  thus the adventure begins  br    br   the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies  each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars  mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity  some planets are small and others are big  many planets are similar to classic mario environments  the best thing about the game are the controls  all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same  but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game  you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game  and it will as well activate the shooting stars  you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment  then there is the graphics  these are by far the best graphics on the wii  it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks  you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games  br    br   my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to  and also the story is pretty weak  the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game  no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives  still these minor problems aside it s a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging  this is the type of game that we ve been waiting for on the wii  br    br   a perfect 10 out of 10 ']\n"
